# PocketBase to OpenAPI Converter

 

> A powerful browser-based tool that converts PocketBase collection schemas to OpenAPI 3.0 specifications with advanced features like collection grouping, selective export, and relation expansion.

**Note from the developer**: I'm primarily a mobile developer with limited web experience. While this project works well, the code structure might not follow best web development practices. I welcome contributions to improve the code quality!



  -  üß© Collection Grouping: API endpoints grouped by collection in Swagger output

   - ‚úèÔ∏è Title Customization: Set custom titles for each collection

  -  ‚úÖ Selective Export: Choose which collections to include in the final spec

   - üîó Relation Expansion: Configure expansion parameters for nested relations

   - üîí Secure Processing: All processing happens in your browser - no data leaves your device

   - üìÅ Export Options: Download OpenAPI spec or copy to clipboard

   - üì± Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices


# How It Works

The converter takes your PocketBase schema JSON file and:

 -   Parses your collection definitions

 -  Detects relations between collections

  -  Generates expansion paths for nested relations

  -  Creates OpenAPI-compliant endpoints for each collection

  -  Allows customization of collection titles and selection

  -  Outputs a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification
